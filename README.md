# gallery-project
This is my gallery project for Team Treehouse where I utilize a JavaScript plugin to create an interactive webpage for users.

This project was relatively straightforward given my prior experience with Bootstrap creating a gallery app. I really liked how I was challenged to use CSS Grid to make it mobile responsive instead of utilizing media queries.

The most challenging part of this was, frankly, the file structuring in the beginning! Once i figured out how to get baguettebox in the right place, and to call everything from the right folder, it was a wrap.
